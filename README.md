# 99_Days_of_Data_Science
Projects, Workshops, and Notebooks associated with my completion of the SuperDataScience Course: 99 days to start your data science career

This course provides a study plan covering courses, portfolio projects, extra resources, and a checklist of actions on the employability track aimed getting beginners looking to transition into the field of data science on the right path.

The courses covered include the following offerings from SuperDataScience:
  - [Careers in Data Science A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/careers-in-data-science/),
  - [Tableau 2020: Hands-On Training](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/hands-on-tableau-for-data-science),
  - [Python A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/python-programming) or [R Programming A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/r-programming),
  - [SQL & Database Design A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/sql-database-design-a-z),
  - [Statistics for Business Analytics & Data Science A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/statistics-business-analytics-a-z),
  - [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/machine-learning),

and a choice of specialization courses from SuperDataScience covering:
  - Machine Learning: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/machine-learning), modules not covered previously,
  - Data Visualizatio: [Tableau 2020 Adanced: Master Tableau in Data Science](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/advanced-tableau-for-data-science),
  - or Data Wrangling: either [Data Manipulation in Python: A Pandas Crash Course](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/data-manipulation-in-python), or [Advanced R Programming](https://www.superdatascience.com/courses/r-advanced-3)

I first went through following the specialization in Data Wrangling and then went back for the Machine Learning specialization as well.
